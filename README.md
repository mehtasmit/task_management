# Laravel API for Users, Projects, and Tasks

This is a Laravel 12-based RESTful API that manages Users, Projects, and Tasks. The application demonstrates a clean, maintainable architecture that applies key SOLID principles using services, repositories, form requests, and resource responses.

---

## ðŸ”§ Project Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   composer install
3. Create .env and configure your database.
4. Run migrations and seeders:

php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

5. Serve the app:

php artisan serve


Obtain a token via:

POST /api/login

Use the token in requests:

Authorization: Bearer {token}


##  Project Structure

The architecture follows a clean, layered approach with strong separation of concerns.

app/
â”œâ”€â”€ Http/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Controllers/ # Thin controllers
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Requests/ # Form request validation
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Resources/ # API response formatting
â”œâ”€â”€ Models/ # Eloquent models
â”œâ”€â”€ Repositories/ # Data access layer
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Interfaces/ # Repository contracts
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/ # Business logic layer
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Interfaces/ # Service contracts


-- Controllers only handle request/response. Business logic is in Services.
-- New service or repository logic can be added via interfaces (e.g. TaskService)
-- Interfaces (ProjectServiceInterface) ensure substitutability
-- Service/Repository interfaces keep contracts small and focused
-- Controllers depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations
